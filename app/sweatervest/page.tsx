          <p>In the winter of 1997, a young woman bought the knitted sweater vest in preparation for a date. After the marriage, this piece of clothing continued to keep her company, it was present when her daughter spoke her first words. When the daughter was old enough, she wore it throughout high school, whether be her filed trips, her 18th birthday or the graduation ceremony. After she left for college, the vest found its new owner with her sibling, who wore it when travelling to Japan. In 2022, the vest was found by us through their yard exchange.</p>
