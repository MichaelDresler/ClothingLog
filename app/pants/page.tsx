          <p>In 2006, a foreign exchange student from Brazil received these homemade lounge pants as a gift from their host family in Vancouver. Created from old window drapes, they were worn and loved throughout the winter of 2006, but were ultimately left in Canada when the student returned home. Years later, these pants were found in the familyâ€™s closet and brought to this shop, where it was traded for a pair of boots.</p>
